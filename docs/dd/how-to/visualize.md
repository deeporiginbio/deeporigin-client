This document describes how to visualize proteins and ligands constructed using the Protein and Ligand classes, and tools to visualize SDF files.

## Visualizing a protein

??? warning "Browser support"
    These visualizations work best on Google Chrome. We are aware of issues on other browsers, especially Safari on macOS.

A protein object can be visualized using `show`:

```python
from deeporigin.drug_discovery import Protein

protein = Protein.from_pdb_id("1EBY")

protein.show()
```

A visualization such as this will be shown:

<iframe 
    src="../../images/1eby.html" 
    width="100%" 
    height="600" 
    style="border:none;"
    title="Protein visualization"
></iframe>

!!! info "Jupyter notebook required"
    Visualizations such as these require this code to be run in a jupyter notebook. We recommend using [these instructions](../../install.md) to install Jupyter.




## Ligands

### `Ligand` objects

The [`Ligand` class](../ref/ligand.md)  is the primary way to work with ligands in Deep Origin.

A ligand object can be visualized using `show`:

```python
from deeporigin.drug_discovery import Ligand

serotonin = Ligand.from_identifier("serotonin")

serotonin.show()
```

If a ligand is backed by a SDF file, a 3D visualization will be shown, similar to:

A visualization such as this will be shown:

    title="Ligand visualization"

If a ligand is not backed by a SDF file, a 2D visualization will be shown:
