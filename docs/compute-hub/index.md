# Compute Hub

The Deep Origin Compute Hub allows you create and use powerful workstations that come with pre-installed software packages. Deep Origin was built to help computational scientists get clean data from their labs and perform advanced analyses and simulations. 

Every Deep Origin Workstation comes pre-installed and pre-configured with this python client and CLI.
