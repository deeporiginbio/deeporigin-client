## For developers

### Install

If you want to install this package to develop it further, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:formiclabs/deeporigin-client.git
cd deeporigin-client
make install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install `deeporigin` in editable mode into the environment. These commands will also add the CLI your PATH so that it can be run
without first activating the virtual environment.

### Running tests

Once installed, tests can be run using:

```bash
make test
```
