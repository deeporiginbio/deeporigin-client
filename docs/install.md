## Quickstart

Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install deeporigin
```

## For developers

### Install

If you want to install this to develop this further:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:formiclabs/deeporigin-client.git
cd deeporigin-client
make install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install `deeporigin` in editable mode in it. The CLI is also linked to, allowing you to use the CLI
without activating the virtual environment first. 

### Running tests

Once installed, tests can be run using:

```bash
make test
```
