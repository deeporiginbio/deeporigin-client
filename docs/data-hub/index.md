# Data Hub

The Deep Origin data hub provides R&D teams a foundation for collaboratively capturing data, extracting insights, and making decisions:

- Databases for capturing rows of data, metadata, and procedures.
    - Customizable columns for capturing structured information such as the age and genotype of a sample.
    - Notebooks such as for common protocols and recording experiments.
    - File columns and notebook attachments for capturing files such as the results of experiments.
    - Reference columns and notebook mentions for capturing relationships, such as the chemical, RNA, antibody, or cell line that an assay characterized.
- Folders for hierarchically organizing data, such as by project, team, or experimental modality.
- Column and file viewers such as for visualizing the sequence of a plasmid or the structure of a chemical or protein.
- Chart studio for interactively analyzing columnar data.
- AI assistant for interactively analyze and visualize data.
- Advanced computational analysis with workflows and workstations.
- Process flows and automations for streamlining data processing, decision-making, and project management.
