# Data hub

!!! danger "Deprecated"
    The Deep Origin DataHub is deprecated. 

The Deep Origin data hub provides R&D teams a foundation for collaboratively capturing data, extracting insights, and making decisions:

- **Databases** for capturing rows of data, metadata, and procedures.
  - Customizable columns for capturing structured information such as the age and genotype of a sample.
  - **Notebooks** such as for common protocols and recording experiments.
  - File columns and notebook attachments for capturing files such as the results of experiments.
  - Reference columns and notebook mentions for capturing relationships, such as the chemical, RNA, antibody, or cell line that an assay characterized.
- **Folders** for hierarchically organizing data, such as by project, team, or experimental modality.
- **Column and file viewers** such as for visualizing the sequence of a plasmid or the structure of a chemical or protein.
- **Chart studio** for interactively analyzing columnar data.
- **AI assistant** for interactively analyze and visualize data.
- **Process flows and automations** for streamlining data processing, decision-making, and project management.
